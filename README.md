### Why this project
Environmental / IoT sensor networks drift over time (seasonality, sensor aging, pollution events). Static models degrade.  
This project demonstrates a **drift-aware streaming pipeline** that:
- monitors drift using **KL divergence** + **Wasserstein distance**
- runs a **lightweight LSTM** as an online predictor/encoder
- flags anomalies using a **calibrated dynamic threshold**
- optionally **adapts online** when drift is detected
- supports a **low-power mode** for edge-like setups
- writes **proof logs** to `data/results.csv`

### ✨ Key Features
- **Streaming pipeline**: processes sensor readings step-by-step (simulated real-time)
- **Drift detection**: KL + Wasserstein on rolling windows
- **Online learning**: optional adaptation ON/OFF (compare performance)
- **Low-power mode**: smaller model + less frequent updates
- **Proof outputs**: a reproducible `data/results.csv` log for plots, screenshots, and evidence

### Install
python -m venv .venv
#### macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
#### Windows (PowerShell):
#### .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt


### Quickstart (CLI)
1) Generate a dataset (synthetic drift + anomaly injection)
  python src/generate_data.py
2) Run streaming drift-aware anomaly detection (CLI)
  python src/online_detection.py
3) Plot the drift region (quick sanity check)
  python src/plot_stream.py

### Running on your own CSV (recommended)
Your CSV should include:
** a timestamp column (string or datetime) **
** 2+ numeric sensor columns (e.g., temperature, turbidity, oxygen, salinity)**

#### Typical columns
timestamp,temperature,turbidity,oxygen,salinity

### 🔋 Low-Power Mode (Edge-friendly)
Low-power mode is intended for:
  Raspberry Pi / low-power experiments
  reduced update frequency
  smaller LSTM hidden size

In the CLI version, low-power mode is typically controlled via constants at the top of online_detection.py
(e.g., smaller hidden size in online_lstm.py, higher UPDATE_EVERY, smaller reference window).

Recommended low-power settings:
smaller LSTM (hidden=8)
update every 10–20 steps
smaller visible buffers / windows

### Drift Adaptation ON/OFF (comparison for evidence)
A key part of the project is demonstrating improvement when adaptation is enabled.
Adaptation OFF: model error tends to remain higher during drift windows
Adaptation ON: model updates on drift (or periodically) → error stabilizes faster
